## 1. Background

As more and more people start to rent properties, the need for an __AFFORDABLE__, easily __ACCESSIBLE__ and __TIME-EFFICIENT__ maintenance solution steadily increases, by both landlord and tenants alike. A system like this would need to be able to effectively CONNECT tenants, landlords and tradies with one another, __STREAMLINING__ the usual process by handling all major events, from the identification to the completion of tasks.

While doing research I came across a survey that said around 82% of tenants have experienced issues during their let period, many of which can take weeks to solve. It showed that __STUDENTS__ were one of the groups who were most common to be affected by these issues.

In a discussion with a local landlord she explained that the reason for this was the difficulty of __ORGANISING__ and keeping on top of these issues that occur with the properties she owns.

In Short, I set out to make an site that allows for the __better maintenance of properties in an attempt to increase the response time for tenant by landlords__.

This solution is set out to work by allowing tenants to __create tickets of issues found at a propert__, therafter being __displayed to their relevant landlords__, allowing landlords to __find tradesmen suited to fix the issues that are stated in the ticket__  

## 2. Wire Frames

My essential and most important pages have all been mocked up into wireframes using Adobe XD and resemble what I would like to achieve as a final result.

## 3. Colour Choices

Every colour in my palette has been chosen due to the underlying theory behind them, and therefore play a significant part in my project.

* Pink
    * A delicate color that is associated with sweet and kind associated with ease and positive emotions.
    * Due to the colours associacion with love, it is also very closely related to growth.
    * This is ideal as a primary colour throughout my design since I would like users to percieve my final project with as a __positive solution__ to __grow their buisness__ in order to gain __increased profits__

* Blue
    * Often associated with depth and stability. 
    * It symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence.
    * Light blue is associated with tranquility, understanding, and softness.
    * Dark blue represents knowledge, power, integrity, and seriousness.
    * The incorpiration of both shades gives not only __variation__ in design choices, but also the opportunity to sell this app as a __intelligent__ and __professional__ solotion to both teants and landlords alike.

* White
    * Means safety, purity, and cleanliness.
    * In advertising, white is associated with coolness and cleanliness. 
    * It can also represent a successful beginning.
    * I have made use of this color to suggest __simplicity__ in my product. As it would make it __less intimidating__ to people who are __not profiecient__ with technology.

* Black
    * A cool, neutral, and balanced color. 
    * The color black is an emotionless, moody color.
    * Typically associated with formality, conservative, and sophisticated.
    * I added this colour to my pallette as i believe it would add a __sophisticated__ edge to my site, __breaking up__ the bright Pink and blues up a bit and __blending elements__ with one another.

## 4. Accessibility

![Main](https://i.imgur.com/hR9u7eQ.png)

According to the audit i did through lighthouse, my ssite complies with the w3 standards 95%, hence is accesible and easily used by most people. I did however loose some points by not uniquely identifying my links, thhough this is only becasue it seemed not neccesary to me during development as my pages themselves are well named.

## 5. GDPR

To adhere to GDPR regulations I made sure to create and include a privacy policy and terms and conditions page in the footer of my document, covering legal aspects. The policies themselves should be satisfactory and to standard as I ensured to use reliable and up to date sources to create mine.

As for the 8 individual laws, I have discussed my compliances with them below. My policies and conditions all contain the relevant information to ensure that I ahere to them fully. This means that I allow my users the right to be informed, of access, to rectification, to erasure, to restrict processing, data portability, to object and right related to automated decision making including profiling.

## 6. Distance Selling

As my product does not sell anything this point is not relevant to my solution. Though it might be worth considering if I were to extend this project further in the future by possibly selling supplies to tradesmen who want to make use of the service. This would be ideal as it makes sure they have the proper equiptment to complete the job.

## 7. Evaluation

### To what extent did you tackle the problem that you set out to solve?

My Main goal for this project was To produce a website suitable for commercial use to give poeple an insight into a new project management system. With the further extension of adding a backend system to create, and display tickets for users to make use of.

For this project i succesfully created the website aspect though could not complete the backend system, mostly due to my unfamiliarity with backend design, hence why I only have a standard ticket system where users can only upload data and it displays, without giving functionality to the tickets themselves. The problem itself will be discussed in the next point.

However, I still believe that I produced a beautiful and functional website that, other than the dashboard, works as inted, using firebase authentication and firestre elements effectively, and with a better understanding and education I believe that I would have completed the project fully.

### What problems did you encounter along the way?

Along the wway I encountered many problems due to a lack of experience with firebase, though attempted my best to resolve them through the provided documentation, my lack of familiarity with Javascript also acted as quite a barrier for the extended scope of my project.

If I had to choose the most diffucult problem that stopped me from fully reaching the extended set out goal, it would be my lack of knowledge and understanding with firebases NoSQL firestore system. 

It took me a long time to wrap my head around this concept and how it worked, and my lack of experiece with working with it, caused me not to be able to complete the dashboard extension to the original site. Though I did attempt to, and succesfully implimented it all on a rough scale.

### How did you test your website/web-application on multiple devices, and what did you find out?

To test my site, I gave it to multiple peers to assess, and give me feedback on what to improve, the responses allowed me to better design my site for enhanced user experience. I was also fortunate enough to have ios and android devices myself to continuesly test the site as I changed things, ensuring animatins and navigations worked smoothly.

### What informed your design choices?

My design choices were inspired by the general design of various modern sites these days, with a set out structure and basic design. the responsive mobile versions alo take from mobile apps hamburger menus
