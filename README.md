## 1. Background

As more and more people start to rent properties, the need for an __AFFORDABLE__, easily __ACCESSIBLE__ and __TIME-EFFICIENT__ maintenance solution steadily increases, by both landlord and tenants alike. A system like this would need to be able to effectively CONNECT tenants, landlords and tradies with one another, __STREAMLINING__ the usual process by handling all major events, from the identification to the completion of tasks.

While doing research I came across a survey that said around 82% of tenants have experienced issues during their let period, many of which can take weeks to solve. It showed that __STUDENTS__ were one of the groups who were most common to be affected by these issues.

In a discussion with a local landlord she explained that the reason for this was the difficulty of __ORGANISING__ and keeping on top of these issues that occur with the properties she owns.

In Short, I set out to make an site that allows for the __better maintenance of properties in an attempt to increase the response time for tenant by landlords__.

    * Has strong emotional correspondence with safety.
    * It is also commonly associated with money and wealth.

    * It symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence.
    * Light blue is associated with tranquility, understanding, and softness.
    * Dark blue represents knowledge, power, integrity, and seriousness.
    * The incorpiration of both shades gives not only __variation__ in design choices, but also the opportunity to sell this app as a __intelligent__ and __professional__ solotion to both teants and landlords alike.

    * Means safety, purity, and cleanliness.     
    * In advertising, white is associated with coolness and cleanliness. 
    * It can also represent a successful beginning.
    * I have made use of this color to suggest __simplicity__ in my product. As it would make it __less intimidating__ to people who are __not profiecient__ with technology.

    * The color gray is an emotionless, moody color 
    * Typically associated with formality, conservative, and sophisticated.
    * I added this colour to my pallette as i believe it would add a __sophisticated__ edge to my site, __breaking up__ the bright green and blues up a bit and __blending elements__ with one another.
