      </p>
      <h2>Services</h2>
      <p>
        12. The description of the Services and any Goods is as set out in the
        Website, catalogues, brochures or other form of advertisement. Any
        description is for illustrative purposes only and there may be small
        discrepancies in the size and colour of any Goods supplied.
      </p>
      <p>
        13. In the case of Services and any Goods made to your special
        requirements, it is your responsibility to ensure that any information
        or specification you provide is accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        14. All Services which appear on the Website are subject to
        availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        15. We can make changes to the Services which are necessary to comply
        with any applicable law or safety requirement. We will notify you of
        these changes.
      </p>
      <h2>Customer responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        16. You must co-operate with us in all matters relating to the Services,
        provide us and our authorised employees and representatives with access
        to any premises under your control as required, provide us with all
        information required to perform the Services and obtain any necessary
        licences and consents (unless otherwise agreed).
      </p>
      <p>
        17. Failure to comply with the above is a Customer default which
        entitles us to suspend performance of the Services until you remedy it
        or if you fail to remedy it following our request, we can terminate the
        Contract with immediate effect on written notice to you.
      </p>
      <h2>Personal information and Registration</h2>
      <p>
        18. When registering to use the Website you must set up a username and
        password. You remain responsible for all actions taken under the chosen
        username and password and undertake not to disclose your username and
        password to anyone else and keep them secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        19. We retain and use all information strictly under the Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        20. We may contact you by using e-mail or other electronic communication
        methods and by pre-paid post and you expressly agree to this.
      </p>
      <h2>Basis of Sale</h2>
      <p>
        21. The description of the Services and any Goods in our website does
        not constitute a contractual offer to sell the Services or Goods. When
        an Order has been submitted on the Website, we can reject it for any
        reason, although we will try to tell you the reason without delay.
      </p>
      <p>
        22. The Order process is set out on the Website. Each step allows you to
        check and amend any errors before submitting the Order. It is your
        responsibility to check that you have used the ordering process
        correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        23. A Contract will be formed for the Services ordered only when you
        receive an email from us confirming the Order (Order Confirmation). You
        must ensure that the Order Confirmation is complete and accurate and
        inform us immediately of any errors. We are not responsible for any
        inaccuracies in the Order placed by you. By placing an Order you agree
        to us giving you confirmation of the Contract by means of an email with
        all information in it (ie the Order Confirmation). You will receive the
        Order Confirmation within a reasonable time after making the Contract,
        but in any event not later than the delivery of any Goods supplied under
        the Contract, and before performance begins of any of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        24. Any quotation or estimate of Fees (as defined below) is valid for a
        maximum period of  7  days  from its date, unless we expressly withdraw
        it at an earlier time.
      </p>
      <p>
        25. No variation of the Contract, whether about description of the
        Services, Fees or otherwise, can be made after it has been entered into
        unless the variation is agreed by the Customer and the Supplier in
        writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        26. We intend that these Terms and Conditions apply only to a Contract
        entered into by you as a Consumer. If this is not the case, you must
        tell us, so that we can provide you with a different contract with terms
        which are more appropriate for you and which might, in some respects, be
        better for you, eg by giving you rights as a business.
      </p>
      <h2>Fees and Payment</h2>
      <p>
        27. The fees (Fees) for the Services, the price of any Goods (if not
        included in the Fees) and any additional delivery or other charges is
        that set out on the Website at the date we accept the Order or such
        other price as we may agree in writing. Prices for Services may be
        calculated on a fixed price or on a standard daily rate basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        28. Fees and charges include VAT at the rate applicable at the time of
        the Order.
      </p>
      <p>
        29. You must pay by submitting your credit or debit card details with
        your Order and we can take payment immediately or otherwise before
        delivery of the Services.
      </p>
      <h2>Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        30. We will deliver the Services, including any Goods, to the Delivery
        Location by the time or within the agreed period or, failing any
        agreement:
      </p>
      <p>a. in the case of Services, within a reasonable time; and</p>
      <p>
        b. in the case of Goods, without undue delay and, in any event, not more
        than 30 days after the day on which the Contract is entered into.
      </p>
      <p>
        31. In any case, regardless of events beyond our control, if we do not
        deliver the Services on time, you can require us to reduce the Fees or
        charges by an appropriate amount (including the right to receive a
        refund for anything already paid above the reduced amount). The amount
        of the reduction can, where appropriate, be up to the full amount of the
        Fees or charges.
      </p>
      <p>
        32. In any case, regardless of events beyond our control, if we do not
        deliver the Goods on time, you can (in addition to any other remedies)
        treat the Contract at an end if:
      </p>
      <p>
        a. we have refused to deliver the Goods, or if delivery on time is
        essential taking into account all the relevant circumstances at the time
        the Contract was made, or you said to us before the Contract was made
        that delivery on time was essential; or
      </p>
      <p>
        b. after we have failed to deliver on time, you have specified a later
        period which is appropriate to the circumstances and we have not
        delivered within that period.
      </p>
      <p>
        33. If you treat the Contract at an end, we will (in addition to other
        remedies) promptly return all payments made under the Contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        34. If you were entitled to treat the Contract at an end, but do not do
        so, you are not prevented from cancelling the Order for any Goods or
        rejecting Goods that have been delivered and, if you do this, we will
        (in addition to other remedies) without delay return all payments made
        under the Contract for any such cancelled or rejected Goods. If the
        Goods have been delivered, you must return them to us or allow us to
        collect them from you and we will pay the costs of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        35. If any Goods form a commercial unit (a unit is a commercial unit if
        division of the unit would materially impair the value of the goods or
        the character of the unit) you cannot cancel or reject the Order for
        some of those Goods without also cancelling or rejecting the Order for
        the rest of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        36. We do not generally deliver to addresses outside England and Wales,
        Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and Channels Islands. If,
        however, we accept an Order for delivery outside that area, you may need
        to pay import duties or other taxes, as we will not pay them.
      </p>
      <p>
        37. You agree we may deliver the Goods in instalments if we suffer a
        shortage of stock or other genuine and fair reason, subject to the above
        provisions and provided you are not liable for extra charges.
      </p>
      <p>
        38. If you or your nominee fail, through no fault of ours, to take
        delivery of the Services at the Delivery Location, we may charge the
        reasonable costs of storing and redelivering them.
      </p>
      <p>
        39. The Goods will become your responsibility from the completion of
        delivery or Customer collection. You must, if reasonably practicable,
        examine the Goods before accepting them.
      </p>
      <h2>Risk and Title</h2>
      <p>
        40. Risk of damage to, or loss of, any Goods will pass to you when the
        Goods are delivered to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        41. You do not own the Goods until we have received payment in full. If
        full payment is overdue or a step occurs towards your bankruptcy, we can
        choose, by notice to cancel any delivery and end any right to use the
        Goods still owned by you, in which case you must return them or allow us
        to collect them.
      </p>
      <h2>Withdrawal  and cancellation</h2>
      <p>
        42. You can withdraw the Order by telling us before the Contract is
        made, if you simply wish to change your mind and without giving us a
        reason, and without incurring any liability.
      </p>
      <p>
        43. This is a distance contract (as defined below) which has the
        cancellation rights (Cancellation Rights) set out below. These
        Cancellation Rights, however, do not apply, to a contract for the
        following goods and services (with no others) in the following
        circumstances:
      </p>
      <p>
        a. contracts where you have specifically requested a visit from us for
        the purpose of carrying out urgent repairs or maintenance, except a
        contract for (a) services in addition to the urgent repairs or
        maintenance requested or (b) goods other than replacement parts
        necessarily used in making the repairs or carrying out the maintenance,
        if we supply those services or goods on the occasion of that visit;
      </p>
      <p>
        b. goods that are made to your specifications or are clearly
        personalised;
      </p>
      <p>c. goods which are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly.</p>
      <h2>Right to cancel</h2>
      <p>
        44. Subject as stated in these Terms and Conditions, you can cancel this
        contract within 14 days without giving any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        45. The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day on
        which you acquire, or a third party, other than the carrier, indicated
        by you, acquires physical possession of the last of the Goods. In a
        contract for the supply of services only (without goods), the
        cancellation period will expire 14 days from the day the Contract was
        entered into. In a contract for the supply of goods over time (ie
        subscriptions), the right to cancel will be 14 days after the first
        delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        46. To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision
        to cancel this Contract by a clear statement setting out your decision
        (eg a letter sent by post, fax or email). You can use the attached model
        cancellation form, but it is not obligatory. In any event, you must be
        able to show clear evidence of when the cancellation was made, so you
        may decide to use the model cancellation form.
      </p>
      <p>
        47. You can also electronically fill in and submit the model
        cancellation form or any other clear statement of the Customer's
        decision to cancel the Contract on our
        website www.droit-management.co.uk . If you use this option, we will
        communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such a cancellation
        in a Durable Medium (eg by email) without delay.
      </p>
      <p>
        48. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send
        your communication concerning your exercise of the right to cancel
        before the cancellation period has expired.
      </p>
      <h2>Commencement of Services in the cancellation period</h2>
      <p>
        49. We must not begin the supply of a service (being part of the
        Services) before the end of the cancellation period unless you have made
        an express request for the service.
      </p>
      <h2>Effects of cancellation in the cancellation period</h2>
      <p>
        50. Except as set out below, if you cancel this Contract, we will
        reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of
        delivery (except for the supplementary costs arising if you chose a type
        of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery
        offered by us).
      </p>
      <h2>Payment for Services commenced during the cancellation period</h2>
      <p>
        51. Where a service is supplied (being part of the Service) before the
        end of the cancellation period in response to your express request to do
        so, you must pay an amount for the supply of the service for the period
        for which it is supplied, ending with the time when we are informed of
        your decision to cancel the Contract. This amount is in proportion to
        what has been supplied in comparison with the full coverage of the
        Contract. This amount is to be calculated on the basis of the total
        price agreed in the Contract or, if the total price were to be
        excessive, on the basis of the market value of the service that has been
        supplied, calculated by comparing prices for equivalent services
        supplied by other traders. You will bear no cost for supply of that
        service, in full or in part, in this cancellation period if that service
        is not supplied in response to such a request.
      </p>
      <h2>Deduction for Goods supplied</h2>
      <p>
        52. We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of
        any Goods supplied, if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling by
        you (ie handling the Goods beyond what is necessary to establish the
        nature, characteristics and functioning of the Goods: eg it goes beyond
        the sort of handling that might be reasonably allowed in a shop). This
        is because you are liable for that loss and, if that deduction is not
        made, you must pay us the amount of that loss.
      </p>
      <h2>Timing of reimbursement</h2>
      <p>
        53. If we have not offered to collect the Goods, we will make the
        reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than:
      </p>
      <p>
        a. 14 days after the day we receive back from you any Goods supplied, or
      </p>
      <p>
        b. (if earlier) 14 days after the day you provide evidence that you have
        sent back the Goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        54. If we have offered to collect the Goods or if no Goods were supplied
        or to be supplied (ie it is a contract for the supply of services only),
        we will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than
        14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to
        cancel this Contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        55. We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as
        you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed
        otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of the
        reimbursement.
      </p>
      <h2>Returning Goods</h2>
      <p>
        56. If you have received Goods in connection with the Contract which you
        have cancelled, you must send back the Goods or hand them over to us
        at   Round Island Cottage, 3 Furzey Close Dorset, BH14 0BN      without
        delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you
        communicate to us your cancellation of this Contract. The deadline is
        met if you send back the Goods before the period of 14 days has expired.
        You agree that you will have to bear the cost of returning the Goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        57. For the purposes of these Cancellation Rights, these words have the
        following meanings:
      </p>
      <p>
        a. distance contract means a contract concluded between a trader and a
        consumer under an organised distance sales or service-provision scheme
        without the simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the
        consumer, with the exclusive use of one or more means of distance
        communication up to and including the time at which the contract is
        concluded;
      </p>
      <p>
        b. sales contract means a contract under which a trader transfers or
        agrees to transfer the ownership of goods to a consumer and the consumer
        pays or agrees to pay the price, including any contract that has both
        goods and services as its object.
      </p>
      <h2>Conformity</h2>
      <p>
        58. We have a legal duty to supply the Goods in conformity with the
        Contract, and will not have conformed if it does not meet the following
        obligation.
      </p>
      <p>59. Upon delivery, the Goods will:</p>
      <p>a. be of satisfactory quality;</p>
      <p>
        b. be reasonably fit for any particular purpose for which you buy the
        Goods which, before the Contract is made, you made known to us (unless
        you do not actually rely, or it is unreasonable for you to rely, on our
        skill and judgment) and be fit for any purpose held out by us or set out
        in the Contract; and
      </p>
      <p>c. conform to their description.</p>
      <p>
        60. It is not a failure to conform if the failure has its origin in your
        materials.
      </p>
      <p>61. We will supply the Services with reasonable skill and care.</p>
      <p>
        62. In relation to the Services, anything we say or write to you, or
        anything someone else says or writes to you on our behalf, about us or
        about the Services, is a term of the Contract (which we must comply
        with) if you take it into account when deciding to enter this Contract,
        or when making any decision about the Services after entering into this
        Contract. Anything you take into account is subject to anything that
        qualified it and was said or written to you by us or on behalf of us on
        the same occasion, and any change to it that has been expressly agreed
        between us (before entering this Contract or later).
      </p>
      <h2>Duration, termination and suspension</h2>
      <p>
        63. The Contract continues as long as it takes us to perform the
        Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        64. Either you or we may terminate the Contract or suspend the Services
        at any time by a written notice of termination or suspension to the
        other if that other:
      </p>
      <p>
        a. commits a serious breach, or series of breaches resulting in a
        serious breach, of the Contract and the breach either cannot be fixed or
        is not fixed within 30 days of the written notice; or
      </p>
      <p>b. is subject to any step towards its bankruptcy or liquidation.</p>
      <p>
        65. On termination of the Contract for any reason, any of our respective
        remaining rights and liabilities will not be affected.
      </p>
      <h2>Successors and our sub-contractors</h2>
      <p>
        66. Either party can transfer the benefit of this Contract to someone
        else, and will remain liable to the other for its obligations under the
        Contract. The Supplier will be liable for the acts of any
        sub-contractors who it chooses to help perform its duties.
      </p>
      Circumstances beyond the control of either party
      <p>
        67. In the event of any failure by a party because of something beyond
        its reasonable control:
      </p>
      <p>
        a. the party will advise the other party as soon as reasonably
        practicable; and
      </p>
      <p>
        b. the party's obligations will be suspended so far as is reasonable,
        provided that that party will act reasonably, and the party will not be
        liable for any failure which it could not reasonably avoid, but this
        will not affect the Customer's above rights relating to delivery (and
        the right to cancel below).
      </p>
      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        68. Your privacy is critical to us. We respect your privacy and comply
        with the General Data Protection Regulation with regard to your personal
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        69. These Terms and Conditions should be read alongside, and are in
        addition to our policies, including our privacy policy
        (www.droit-management.co.uk/PrivacyPolicy) and cookies policy
        (www.droit-management.co.uk/CookiesPolicy).
      </p>
      <p>70. For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions:</p>
      <p>
        a. 'Data Protection Laws' means any applicable law relating to the
        processing of Personal Data, including, but not limited to the Directive
        95/46/EC (Data Protection Directive) or the GDPR.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. 'GDPR' means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
      </p>
      <p>
        c. 'Data Controller', 'Personal Data' and 'Processing' shall have the
        same meaning as in the GDPR.
      </p>
      <p>
        71. We are a Data Controller of the Personal Data we Process in
        providing the Services and Goods to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        72. Where you supply Personal Data to us so we can provide Services and
        Goods to you, and we Process that Personal Data in the course of
        providing the Services and Goods to you, we will comply with our
        obligations imposed by the Data Protection Laws:
      </p>
      <p>
        a. before or at the time of collecting Personal Data, we will identify
        the purposes for which information is being collected;
      </p>
      <p>b. we will only Process Personal Data for the purposes identified;</p>
      <p>
        c. we will respect your rights in relation to your Personal Data; and
      </p>
      <p>
        d. we will implement technical and organisational measures to ensure
        your Personal Data is secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        73. For any enquiries or complaints regarding data privacy, you can
        e-mail: ethanmoffatt888@icloud.com.
      </p>
      <h2>Excluding liability</h2>
      <p>
        74. The Supplier does not exclude liability for: (i) any fraudulent act
        or omission; or (ii) death or personal injury caused by negligence or
        breach of the Supplier's other legal obligations. Subject to this, we
        are not liable for (i) loss which was not reasonably foreseeable to both
        parties at the time when the Contract was made, or (ii) loss (eg loss of
        profit) to your business, trade, craft or profession which would not be
        suffered by a Consumer - because we believe you are not buying the
        Services and Goods wholly or mainly for your business, trade, craft or
        profession.
      </p>
      Governing law, jurisdiction and complaints
      <p>
        75. The Contract (including any non-contractual matters) is governed by
        the law of England and Wales.
      </p>
      <p>
        76. Disputes can be submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts
        of England and Wales or, where the Customer lives in Scotland or
        Northern Ireland, in the courts of respectively Scotland or Northern
        Ireland.
      </p>
      <p>
        77. We try to avoid any dispute, so we deal with complaints as
        follows: Personal reflection and responses.
